    <h1>I’m Sorry</h1>

    <p>
        I crossed a boundary and I understand that now.
        That was not right, and I take responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        You deserve trust, space, and respect.
        I am working on myself.
    </p>

    <p class="final">
        No pressure. No expectations.
