i understand why r u upset , i was wrong , i m sorry for hurting you , i want to know not argue , i will fix this


i intended care 
u experienced control 


from u r pov its surviellance , lack of trust 
but for me it is knowing about you 


i will stop asking where are you with whom are you what are you doing whats the need 

i understand now that my questions made you feel controlled but that wasnt my intention and i respect how it felt to you 
I M SORRY 
I TRUST YOU 
I WILL GIVE U SPACE 


i do ask u questions because i fear losing you 
i cannot protect you just by knowing where r u 
i cannot prevent any loss by knowing where r u 
but the one u r with can do both protect and prevent loss 


i ask you because 
i feel uneasy 
i feel frightened 
i imagine scenarios 


i realise my fear made me cross your boundaries 
i wasnt trying to control you i was anxious about you 
still this is my resposibility not yours 
i will work on it

    </p>

    <p class="final">
        take all the time u need but dont just forget about me
