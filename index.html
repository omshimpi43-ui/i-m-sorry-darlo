    <h1>I’m Sorry</h1>

    <p>
        I understand why you’re upset. I crossed a boundary, and that was wrong.
        I’m truly sorry for hurting you.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I believed was care felt like control to you.
        I see that now, and I respect how it made you feel.
    </p>

    <p>
        My questions came from fear, not from a lack of trust.
        Still, that fear is my responsibility — not yours.
        I am working on myself.
    </p>

    <p class="final">
        Take all the time you need. I LOVE YOU
